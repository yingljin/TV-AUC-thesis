# Comparing estimators of Incident/Dynamic AUC and concordance 

This repository saves the code scripts needed for reproducing the simulation and case study results in the corresponding manuscript. Below is a summary of content of the code folder:

- Simulation
  
    Includes functions for I/D-AUC and concordance estimators, functions for generate data and calculated true estimands, the full script for simulation, as well as an example of one iteration in the simulation process.
    
- DataAppl
  
    Includes functions specifically for data application section, code for data pre-processing and calculate in- and out-of sample estimands by K-fold corss validation. 

- Docs
  
    Includes Rmd files used to produced figures and tables in the manuscript. as well as a step-by-step guide fo the simulation study.
